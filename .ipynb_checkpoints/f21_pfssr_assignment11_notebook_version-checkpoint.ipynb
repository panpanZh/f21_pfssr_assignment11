    "a) Let's watch some videos! I recommend all the videos in this series (for future learning), but we will just focus on two now. Watch the first half of this video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV&index=3) -- just the part about forking, you can ignore pull requests!  Then watch this video:\n",

    "\n",
    "b) Using what you learned in 0a, **fork** my GitHub repository (remote repo) to your own account, then **clone** to your hard drive (local repo) using GitKraken (or use the command-line if you want the extra challenge).  After finishing EACH problem below, make sure to STAGE and COMMIT with a comment (e.g., \"Just finished Part 1! Git is fun!\" or whatever).  Then PUSH back to GitHub."

    "\n",
    "By default, GitHub repos are public (promoting open source sharing of code), but of course you are more than welcome to make your code for this assignment private, as is your right!  Unfortunately, it's a little bit complicated because GitKraken recently made a change that the free version of their software doesn't allow for private repo access, and you need the paid version.  So here are 3 ways to do this privately:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) GitKraken partners with GitHub to provide a free pack of resources (including the pro version of GitKraken) for *students*.  That's you!  So you can sign up here *only if you want to do this*: https://education.github.com/pack?utm_source=github+gitkraken\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Just keep your GitHub repo public while you're working on this project.  Use free GitKraken.  Then switch the GitHub repo to Private only when you're done using GitKraken to push to GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Keep the repo private and use the terminal git commands in the YouTube video for Problem 0a.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the repo private:\n",
    "On your GitHub repo, go to Settings > Manage Access > Manage (under Public Repository) > Change Visibility.  Then add me (jkbye) as a 'collaborator' so I can see it: Settings > Manage Access > Invite a Collaborator (green button) > add 'jkbye'."
